# E-Commerce Website With HTML CSS JavaScript

This is a multi-page fully responsive website made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript Technologies.
My aim for this project is to make it completely dynamic using JavaScript, right from adding the products to naming them, setting their prices, cart functionality, admin dashboard. 

At this stage when I am uploading this project on my github repo it is just a static website with very few dynamics like dynamic navigation menu and small animations.
